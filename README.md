# 📊 California Hospital Fiscal Report Analysis

**Author:** Lillian Ichwan  
**Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Excel, Tableau  

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes quarterly fiscal reports for all hospitals in **California**. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and used to build a **Decision Tree Regressor** model for financial trend analysis. The final insights were visualized using **Tableau** to provide an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

## 📂 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Loaded quarterly fiscal reports of California hospitals using **Pandas**
- Cleaned data by:
  - Handling missing values (imputation techniques)
  - Identifying and addressing skewness in numerical features
  - Removing duplicate and inconsistent records  
- Exported cleaned dataset to **Excel** for additional formatting  

### 2️⃣ Data Modeling
- Built a **Decision Tree Regressor** model using **scikit-learn**
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **R² Score**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Identified key fiscal trends and features influencing financial outcomes  

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization
- Used **Matplotlib & Seaborn** to visualize:
  - Distribution of hospital revenues and expenditures  
  - Trends over different quarters  
  - Correlation between financial variables  
- Created an interactive **Tableau Dashboard** for easy exploration
